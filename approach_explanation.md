# PDF Intelligence System - Technical Approach

## Overview
This system implements an offline, CPU-optimized document intelligence engine that analyzes PDF collections based on user persona and tasks. The solution prioritizes speed, accuracy, and resource efficiency while maintaining high relevance in section extraction and ranking.

## Architecture & Design

### Core Components
1. **PDF Processor**: Extracts text and identifies document structure using PyMuPDF
2. **Intelligence Engine**: Performs semantic analysis using lightweight embeddings
3. **Ranking System**: Combines semantic similarity with keyword relevance scoring
4. **Output Generator**: Creates structured JSON results matching specifications

### Technical Implementation

**PDF Processing Pipeline**:
- Text extraction with structure preservation using PyMuPDF
- Section identification via regex patterns for headers and titles
- Text cleaning and normalization to handle OCR artifacts
- Paragraph segmentation for improved context understanding

**Semantic Analysis**:
- Lightweight sentence transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ~90MB)
- Persona and job-to-be-done combined into query embeddings
- Cosine similarity calculation for semantic relevance scoring
- TF-IDF analysis for keyword-based relevance boosting

**Ranking Algorithm**:
- Hybrid scoring: 70% semantic similarity + 30% keyword relevance
- Domain-specific keyword boosting for analytical terms
- Score normalization and filtering of low-relevance sections
- Top-N selection with importance ranking

**Subsection Refinement**:
- Context extraction around identified sections
- Sentence-level content cleaning and structuring
- Length optimization for readability (max 400 characters)
- Quality filtering to ensure meaningful content

## Performance Optimizations

- **CPU-Only Processing**: No GPU dependencies, optimized for CPU inference
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming text processing and batch embedding generation
- **Model Size**: Lightweight transformer model under 100MB
- **Caching**: Model weights cached in Docker image for faster startup
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Minimal passes through documents with efficient text processing

## Scalability & Reliability

The system handles 3-10 documents efficiently within the 60-second constraint through:
- Parallel section processing where possible
- Early filtering of irrelevant content
- Optimized embedding computations
- Robust error handling and graceful degradation

This approach ensures consistent performance across various document types while maintaining high relevance in extracted content for diverse personas and analytical tasks.
